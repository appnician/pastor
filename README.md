Pastor store all your passwords without storing them anywhere.

How it works:

* You enter a pass-phrase

> You have to remember the pass-phrase.

* The output is a four digit response code. It is a checksum of your pass-phrase.

> You should remember the response code so that you can see if you entered the pass-phrase correctly.

* You are then asked to enter a door id.

>This can be for example an email address. The door id can be public. You can write down all your door without compromising your security. They can of course also be kept secret.

* Given a door id the response is a password.

>The password is generated by combining the pass-phrase and the door id creating a new hash that then roughly becomes the password.

Whenever you have the same pass phrase and the same door id, you get the same password. You can have virtually an endless amount of passwords.

None of these passwords are ever stored. The pass-phrase is not a master password to some stored list of passwords.

There is much room for improvement in this script. I wrote it to help an extremely forgetful person manage a lot of passwords without compromising security. The password quality is just adequate, but I think the idea has potential to be very secure.

Maybe this can integrated in the browser like an purely automatic password manager that you can take with you from one computer / phone to another without the export / import which can be complicated.

You can say that this script is for people who store passwords on paper in secret places because they cannot possibly remember all of them.
